# chatapp
This is a school project I did with three colleagues (Daniel Gilgenreiner, Andreas Lotteritsch, Andreas Drabosenig). We did it in our fourth year of our higher technical school (HTL-Villach/Informatik). This idea was to built a chatapp, which showed us interesting details about noSQL-databases and android.
